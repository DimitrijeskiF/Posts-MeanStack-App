This is my first Full Stack application developed in MEAN Stack technology (Mongo DB, Express.јs, Angular and Node.јs).
Angular is used to create a user interface,
Node.js and Express.js are used to create REST APIs for landing data from a database
and MongoDB as database to store the data.

The main idea of this application is to show how CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations work. Also, I provide an authentication method with all sorts of saving user data.
